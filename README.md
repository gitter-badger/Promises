ECMA-6 Promises polyfill
==========================

**100%** compliant **Promises/A+ implementation**, and as close as possible to the **ES6 Spec**.

This polyfill can be used as a stand-alone or together with the **hAzzlejS** Javascript library.

Be aware that ECMA-6 already have been on the table for some years now, and ECMA-7 are sneaking in the shadows, so the specs will change again and again...

**Note!!** For better performance you should load the **ECMA-6 setImmediate** polyfill first, else it will fall back to a *normal* **timeOut**.
